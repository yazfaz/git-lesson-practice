Paragraph 1

Today is my frist day at MakerSquare I'm so nervous, anxious, excited about the next 10 weeks! What if I d'ont get along with my pair! What if I can't kip up with the pace of the class! What if I fall behind! What if it's to easy! What i I can't physically handle the work! What if my new slass mates and I don't get along! Oh boy so many "What if's."

Paragraph 2

But then again what if I absolutely love my new classmates? What if this programming stuff really isn't so bad after all? What if my teachers are amazing? What if I'm having "ah-ha!"" moments left and right? What if I can build anything I want to? What if I walk out of here being BFFs with everyone I meet? What if this is the first time ever that I find myself absolutely loving school?
